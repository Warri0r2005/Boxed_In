# Boxed_In
Boxed In is a puzzle game around moving boxes in a warehouse, created using C.

To play, enter either w, a, s, d into the command line to move the player and push boxes around.

If you want to play the game, open the .exe file.

Check out the script included in this repo to see the code used for this game 
which is suprisingly complicated for such a simple concept.

The game was completed in a matter of a few weeks and has not been optimised since.
